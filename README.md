A Python package for comparing groups and measuring associations using robust statistics.

This package is a port of Rand R. Wilcox's R library [WRS](https://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/rwilcox/software/). The functions in this repository, as well as the issues of robustness, are described in his book "[Introduction to Robust Estimation and Hypothesis Testing](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8f8nBb4__EYC&gl=ca&hl=en-CA&source=productsearch&utm_source=HA_Desktop_US&utm_medium=SEM&utm_campaign=PLA&pcampaignid=MKTAD0930BO1&gclid=CjwKCAiA44LzBRB-EiwA-jJipJzyqx9kwNMq5MMU7fG2RrwBK9F7sirX4pfhS8wO7k9Uz_Sqf2P28BoCYzcQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)".
