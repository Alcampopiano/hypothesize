# Hypothesize: robust statistics in Python

![Screenshot](img/dist_overlay.png)

Hypothesize is a robust statistics library for 
Python based on Rand R. Wilcox's R package [WRS](https://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/rwilcox/software/). 
With Hypothesize you can compare groups and 
measure associations using methods that outperform 
traditional statistcal approaches in terms of power 
and accuracy. 

For more information on robust methods please see Wilcox's book 
[Introduction to Robust Estimation and Hypothesis Testing](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8f8nBb4__EYC&gl=ca&hl=en-CA&source=productsearch&utm_source=HA_Desktop_US&utm_medium=SEM&utm_campaign=PLA&pcampaignid=MKTAD0930BO1&gclid=CjwKCAiA44LzBRB-EiwA-jJipJzyqx9kwNMq5MMU7fG2RrwBK9F7sirX4pfhS8wO7k9Uz_Sqf2P28BoCYzcQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds).

## Function Guide

### [Comparing groups with a single factor](function_guide.md#Comparing-groups-with-a-single-factor)

For statistical tests analogous to a 1-way ANOVA or T-tests. 
That is, group tests that have a single factor. 

- [Independent groups](function_guide.md#independent-groups)
- [Dependent groups](function_guide.md#dependent-groups)

### [Comparing groups with two factors](function_guide.md#comparing-groups-with-two-factors)

For statistical tests analogous to a 2-way ANOVA. 
That is, group tests that have a two factors.

- [Dependent groups](function_guide.md#dependent-groups_1)
- [Mixed designs](function_guide.md#mixed_designs)

### [Measuring associations](function_guide.md#measuring-associations)

For statistical tests and measurements that include robust correlations and tests of independence.
Note that regression functions will be added here eventually.
