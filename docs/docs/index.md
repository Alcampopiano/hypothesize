# Hypothesize: robust statistics in Python

![Screenshot](img/dist_overlay.png)

Hypothesize is a robust statistics library for 
Python based on Rand R. Wilcox's R package [WRS](https://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/rwilcox/software/). 
With Hypothesize you can compare groups and 
measure associations using methods that outperform 
traditional statistical approaches in terms of power 
and accuracy. 

For more information on robust methods please see Wilcox's book 
[Introduction to Robust Estimation and Hypothesis Testing](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8f8nBb4__EYC&gl=ca&hl=en-CA&source=productsearch&utm_source=HA_Desktop_US&utm_medium=SEM&utm_campaign=PLA&pcampaignid=MKTAD0930BO1&gclid=CjwKCAiA44LzBRB-EiwA-jJipJzyqx9kwNMq5MMU7fG2RrwBK9F7sirX4pfhS8wO7k9Uz_Sqf2P28BoCYzcQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds).
